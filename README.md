# mini-rush_snake

## Introduction

A mini-rush is a student organized speed coding.
The idea is to code something in a really short time.

## Snake
*(The subject is available in french, see `sujet.txt`.)*

We had to code a **snake** in C, console displayed, in **2 hours**.
This include the **growing system** and the fact that you loose
on **hiting a wall**. I didn't had the time to make the **apple
disapear** and randomly appear again, but the game is almost
complete.
